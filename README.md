# TextAnalyserLib

Welcome to the TextAnalyserLib repository
TextAnalyserLib provides a light implementation of "In Order" Traveral of Binary Search and Threaded Trees. 
TextAnalyserLib is written in C# and targets the .NET Framework.

Using
The documentation for TreeLib is located at www.foobar.com

Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please contact me if you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to create a pull request.

Please do keep in mind that I want to keep the basic tree implementations as streamlined as possible. On the other hand, I am interested in exposing operations that can be done more efficiently at the level of tree nodes, rather than the collection-oriented interfaces that are exposed to consumers of the library.

There are no formal coding guidelines at this time. Just make new code look like what's already there.

Building
The TextAnalyserLib solution builds with Visual Studio 2017. Open the solution file located at TextAnalyser\TextAnalyser.sln. There are several projects contained therein:
- TextAnalyserLib the Library implementation
- Test the unit tests
- Main a short program that use the library
